# A simulation of the game "Snakes and Ladders".

_What is the minimun number of die rolls needed to win the game?_<br>

To find out, I wrote this simulation.

To choose the number of players (1-4) and the number of simulations to run (min: 100, max: as much as you want), run the .py file. 

The complete results and statistics can be found in the .ipynb file.

This program is based on my own board. There are different board designs available in the market, so this answers the question for the one shown in the image below.
